# tidbyt-dockerfile-google-cloud-run
A google cloud run dockerfile for running Tidbyt Pixlet

Dockerfile shows how to install Tidbyt on Google Cloud Run
main.py shows how several tidbyt graphics get rendered and how they can get transferred to multiple tidbyts
sample1.star and sample2.star a just demo .star files to demonstrate the logic of the setup

Cronjobs can be scheduled with Google Cloud Scheduler or probably cheaper f.e. using make.com and doing http GET requests.

Enjoy!
